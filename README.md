## 1. Purpose
Indievelopment believes that our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of ethnicity, disability, gender, religion, beliefs, or sexual orientation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behaviour as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, media, exhibitors and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.

All determinations of appropriate or inappropriate behaviour are in Indievelopment's sole discretion and the decision(s) of the Indievelopment representative's onsite will be final.

## 2. Expected Behaviour
- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert the conference team if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, media, speakers, volunteers, organisers, venue staff, sponsors, or exhibitors.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.

## 5. What to Do If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behaviour
If you are subject to unacceptable behaviour, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organiser as soon as possible. All reports will remain completely confidential.

The Indievelopment team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behaviour to feel safe for the duration of the conference. You can report unacceptable behaviour to any member of staff. Staff can be found at the entrance of the Venue, or you may email any of the contacts below.

## 6. Scope
We expect all conference participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
